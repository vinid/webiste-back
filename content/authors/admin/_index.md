Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, I am a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford University with
[Prof. Dan Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/).

You can find my work in the main track of different AI venues (e.g., [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472), 
[ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf), [ICLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KRLUvxh8uaX), 
[NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [EACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.143/))
 and Journals (e.g., [Cognitive Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12963),
  [Nature PJQI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0248-6)) 
  and my work as also been featured in press or in company media outlets 
  (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html),
[2](https://www.photonics.com/Articles/Neural_Network_Improves_Quantum_Tomography/a65552),
[3](https://www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu/notizia.php?idArt=21787),
[4](https://blog.coveo.com/multi-brand-personalization-in-ecommerce/)).

I have experience in building and deploying large language models (e.g., [FashionCLIP](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip)), 
model understanding (e.g., [VLMs Analysis](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KRLUvxh8uaX)) and fairness in recommender systems (e.g., [EvalRS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0.pdf)).


I recently joined the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) initiative and donate monthly; 
You should consider joining, if you can. While I haven't formally [pledged](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) yet, I hope to be able to do so soon.
