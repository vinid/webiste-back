Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, I am a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford University with
[Prof. Dan Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/). I am passionate about working across the entire spectrum of AI and more recent generative AI.
 

I love the multifaceted nature of the field; it allows me to engage in different tasks and contribute to the development:

* From constructing foundation models (e.g., [Instruction Tuning](https://outerbounds.com/blog/custom-llm-tuning/),
[LLaMA and LoRA](https://outerbounds.com/blog/llm-tuning-metaflow/), 
[FashionCLIP](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip));
* To gaining deep insights into their inner workings (e.g., [Compositionality in Vision and Language](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KRLUvxh8uaX)); 
* Moreover, I recognize the importance of safety and ethical implications of Generative AI, making it an integral part of my work (e.g., [DallE And Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03759)). 
By actively participating in each stage of the process, I aim to contribute to the advancement and responsible use of generative AI technology.

My work appeared in different AI venues (e.g., [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472), 
[ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf), [ICLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KRLUvxh8uaX), 
[NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [EACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.143/)).
  and it has as also been featured in press or in company media outlets 
  (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html),
[2](https://www.photonics.com/Articles/Neural_Network_Improves_Quantum_Tomography/a65552),
[3](https://www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu/notizia.php?idArt=21787),
[4](https://blog.coveo.com/multi-brand-personalization-in-ecommerce/)).

* I often collaborate with industry folks (e.g., [Coveo](https://blog.coveo.com/multi-brand-personalization-in-ecommerce/), [OuterBounds](https://outerbounds.com/blog/llm-tuning-metaflow/)).
* My GitHub projects have collected many stars over the past few years (e.g., [Contextualized Topic Models](https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models/), [RecList](https://github.com/RecList/reclist), [FashionCLIP](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip))

I recently joined the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) initiative and donate monthly.
