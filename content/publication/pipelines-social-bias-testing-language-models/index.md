abstract: "The maturity level of language models is now at a stage in which many companies rely on them to solve various tasks. However, while research has shown how biased and harmful these models are, **systematic ways of integrating social bias tests into development pipelines are still lacking. 
This short paper suggests how to use these verification techniques in development pipelines.** We take inspiration from software testing and suggest addressing social bias evaluation as software testing. We hope to open a discussion on the best methodologies to handle social bias testing in language models."
